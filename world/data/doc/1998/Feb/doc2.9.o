dbase (["msg":"[  9] about guais                              雪豹(Snowcat) (Sun Feb  8)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Please go to check them out, before you post your opinions. Many NPCswere designed for mid hands to fight or NK to gain 道行 and  潜能.Let me repeat here:  - they are often NOT highly enforced;  - they are ranging from 100yr to 1000 yr;  - they are often better and give even faster 道行/潜能 than bajiao guai;  - they are so many that the players should never have shortage;If you still doubt about them, then you really have to go to try them.Besides in the post, I only listed a small amount of them. There aremore NPCs waiting for you in this MUD.[65] re: 稀有动物                             雪豹(Snowcat)(Sat Feb  7)----------------------------------------------------------------------there are more NPCs in this mud. they have been waiting for youthere for a long time. but so far seldom players go to visit them.i can give you some hints here. for example:- 草头神: in meishan, can split into multiple npcs.there are 2 places where you can find them- 水蛭精: in pansi, can split into multiple npcs.there are 2 places where you ca^@n find them- 小童 (黑鼠怪, 黄犰怪, ..., 水獾怪): in xiaoxitian, they don'tsplit but are grouped together.there are 3 places where you can find them- 小妖: in yalong mountain (near pingding), can't split butalways grouped together as 3 or 4,there are 5 places where you can find them.and there are many more like that, please go to try. compared tothem, bajiao guais are less attractive. check the map \"help map-qujing\",there are a lot of npcs, many even hidden. for example, 50% of 碗子山in baoxiang have hidden who can jump out as group npcs. i saw 4 or 5mid/high hands go to 碗子山 to fight them regularly.","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Feb/doc2.9","id":"doc","name":"文档",])
